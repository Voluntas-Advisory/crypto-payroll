Resources for organizations on paying employees in cryptocurrency.

# Description
Employees are opting to recieve their salaries in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum more and more as blockchain technologies gain popularity, and it makes sense for companies that do international business to keep an open mind to offering crypto as a payment option.

In addition to faster, cheaper, and more secure payments, crypto allows access to a pool of talent that can do business unencumbered by local banking regulations and currency exchange fees.

# Volatility
Cryptocurrencies are volatile due to their speculative nature as an asset, in that they have nothing backing them but electricity and hope.  However, organizations can avoid that volatility by holding assets in stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, UST, and others.  The name implies that these coins remain stable by being pinned to the US Dollar, so they can be used as a hedge to avoid loss (or gain) of value.  Stablecoins can be converted to other cryptocurrencies as needed, or can be sent from wallet to wallet.

# Tax Implications
Crypto is still in the legal gray area in many parts of the world, but many countries have given the green light to organizations to fully embrace blockchain platforms as replacements for Tradfi, or traditional finance platforms.  Even with the ambiguities in crypto's taxation status, there are still ways for companies to pay their employees and stay compliant.

# Onboarding
The most basic method for paying employees in crypto is simply having the employee share the wallet address for the cryptocurrency they agree to be paid in.  This is common practice in the crypto world, but isn't reliable enough to be used within an organization.  This method comes with inherent security issues, and a test amount should always be sent and confirmed to verify that the employee is the owner of the wallet.  If the wallet address of the employee changes for any reason, it is the employee's responsibility to notify HR and perform another test deposit.
